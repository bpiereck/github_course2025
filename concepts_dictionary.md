# Concepts

- **Git:**

Software keeps tracks of versions and changes. Can help to navigate to different versions.


- **GitHub:**

Can colect different Git projects. Online repository (BackUp)

## Conceptual areas:

1. Dev. Area: Local folder where you work

2. Staging Area: Place where you add files to prepare for the commit. It is specially important when working with several files, and I need to classify the ones that I want to commit together.

3. Local repository: Where you store the versions, `.git` folder.
